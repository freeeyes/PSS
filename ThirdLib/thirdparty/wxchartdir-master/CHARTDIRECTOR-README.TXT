*************************** Documentation ****************************

ChartDirector includes comprehensive documentation and plenty of 
sample codes and projects. 

The ChartDirector documentation can be found in the "doc" subdirectory 
under the directory where you extract or install ChartDirector. For 
ChartDirector distributions installed by installers, a short cut will 
also be created in Start/Programs/ChartDirector for easy access to the 
documentation.

ChartDirector documentation is available in CHM (Compiled Help File) 
and HTML formats. The ChartDirector distributions only includes one of 
the formats (CHM on Windows, HTML on other OS). If you need the other 
format, you may download from:

    http://www.advsofteng.com/download.html

           *** IMPORTANT NOTES FOR VIEWING CHM FILES ***

- On Windows, downloaded CHM files, or CHM files extracted from 
downloaded zip files, must be unblocked before they can be viewed. To 
do this, from the File Explorer, right click on the CHM file, select 
Properties, click the "Unblock" button, and press "OK". 

- Due to security reasons, the CHM documentation should be on the 
local hard disk (not a network drive), otherwise Windows may consider 
it to be "untrusted" and refuse to open it. 

- On some Windows machines, the CHM viewer may not support path names 
with URL reserve characters (such as "C++"). To avoid uncertainties, 
it is suggested the directory path that contain the CHM file should 
consist of ASCII characters only.
